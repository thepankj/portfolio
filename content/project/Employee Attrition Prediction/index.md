title: Employee Attrition Prediction
summary: 'In this project, I had to predict the attrition rates of employees given 28 features 
          like Age, Department, Gender, etc.
          Did lots of EDA, Visualization, Feature Engineering and Modelling.
          Used `Random Forest Classifier` and parameter tuning.
          It was a competition wherein I was placed in the top 50 percentile of all participants.'
